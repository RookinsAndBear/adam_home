    """Fetches output from an STK/Astrogator MCS
    
    This class is used to create a list of desired outputs from an 
    STK Astroagtor Mission Control Sequence (MCS).
    This is specifically designed to support mutiple runs, such as
    in a parametric study. 
    
    This class is also used to retrieve the list of outputs.
    When fetching the data (using update(), the values are 
    returned in rows. The calling code also specifies an index number
    which represents the column index. The output is a table, with the
    desired outputs in each row. Each column contains the values for 
    each different run. Conceptually, it returns a table of the form:
    
              run_1   run_2  run_3 run_4 ...
    output_1   ###     ###    ###   ###  ...
    output_2   ###     ###    ###   ###  ...
    output_3   ###     ###    ###   ###  ...
    ...
    
    NOTE: Internally the class stores the runs as rows, and the
    desired output values as columns. But the supported workflow
    needs the runs as columns, the output is transposed whenever
    requested.
    
    This class can save the resulting values to a csv file, and 
    load from it using pandas.
    
    This class can create a pandas dataframe.

        * The current design is to add all the events, getting the
          rownames, then the update, and then get the dataout.

          order, or iterated between.
